 Take skills learned over the past three semesters and create an auction website for Noroff.
 The javascript has been the main focus trying to implement best practice and ES6.

# Sources
There are sources taken from everywhere, code has it referenced in comments, here is an overview:

Cards from bootstrap in index, profile, login, listings are all taken from free sources then adapted to fit the needs of the website:

https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/product-cards/
https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/profiles/ 


It is also referenced in the styles.scss where custom code directly taken from source is used. Some colours have been changed for the backgrounds to suit the needs of the project.

These links also contain links to footer and headers boostrap sources from online.
